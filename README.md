# Running Route Planner Web App
A simple web app made using flask and bootstrap that, when given a length and a location, will generate a circuit of that length nearby. This can be used to plan a running route. To use the web app please run:
> python app.py  

Then visit the link shown in terminal to interact with the web app

## Example Routes:
These routes were created at random locations  

**Lower Sloane Street, London**
![Example Route 1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57597103/133622649-864fc488-370d-4f2f-829f-9b7b6c857e90.png)  

**Ollerton Road, London**
![Example Route 2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57597103/133622723-815b56c7-cfc3-449f-8fc7-557750bac017.png)  

## TODO:
* Add loading screen while paths are being generated
* Implement heuristics as suggested in R.Lewis' paper
